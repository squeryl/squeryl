h3. Q: What kind of caching mechanism is supported ?

h3. A: No caching mechanism is supported at the moment.

However with Scala's lazy val's, a rudimentary (but useful) form of 
caching with lazy loading is possible :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[  
  class Song(val id, val title: String, val artistId: Long)  {
    lazy val artist = artists.where(a => a.id === artistId).single     
  } 
]]></script>

In this case, aSong.artist would be fetched lazily and only once.
