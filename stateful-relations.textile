h3. Declaring Stateful Relations

Stateful relations have the same methods as stateless ones, the main difference is that wherever you have a Query[A] in a stateless 
becomes an Iterable[A] in a stateful relation.

Stateful relations are defined exactly the same way as their stateless counterpart, with the exception that the *leftStateful* and *rightStateful* methods are 
invoke instead of *left* and *right* :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

class Course(val subjectId: Long) extends SchoolDb2Object {

  //students is a ManyToMany[Student,CourseSubscription], it extends Query[Students]
  lazy val students = SchoolDb2.courseSubscriptions.leftStateful(this)
}

class Student(val firstName: String, val lastName: String) extends SchoolDb2Object {

  //courses is a ManyToMany[Course,CourseSubscription], it extends Query[Course]
  lazy val courses = SchoolDb2.courseSubscriptions.rightStateful(this)  
}
  
class Course(val subjectId: Long) extends SchoolDb2Object {

  lazy val subject: ManyToOne[Subject] = SchoolDb.subjectToCourses.rightStateful(this)
}

class Subject(val name: String) extends SchoolDb2Object {

  lazy val courses: OneToMany[Course] = SchoolDb.subjectToCourses.leftStateful(this)
}

]]></script>

h3. StatefulOneToMany and StatefulManyToOne

Methods in stateful relations are very similar than their stateless counterpart, their signatures are slightly different, and have a refresh method. Note the *relation* property, it is the stateless relation objects that provides the persistence related functionality. A stateful relation is in fact a wrapper over a stateless one, with caching.  

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

class StatefulOneToMany[M](val relation: OneToMany[M]) extends Iterable[M] {
  
  def refresh: Unit

  def associate(m: M):Unit

  def deleteAll: Int
}

class StatefulManyToOne[O <: KeyedEntity[_]](val relation: ManyToOne[O]) {

  def refresh: Unit

  def one: Option[O]

  def assign(o: O): Unit

  def delete: Boolean
}

]]></script>


h3. StatefulManyToMany

The similarity between StatefulManyToMany and ManyToMany is also very apparent :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

class StatefulManyToMany[O <: KeyedEntity[_],A <: KeyedEntity[_]](val relation: ManyToMany[O,A]) extends Iterable[O] {

  def refresh: Unit
  def associate(o: O, a: A)
  def associate(o: O): A
  def dissociate(o: O): Boolean
  def dissociateAll: Int
  def associations: Iterable[A]  
}

]]></script>
