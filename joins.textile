h2. Joining with *from* 

A two table join :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[
class Playlist(var id: Long, var name: String, var path: String) extends KeyedEntity[Long] {
 
  import MusicDb._
 
  // a two table join :
  def songsInPlaylistOrder =
    from(playlistElements, songs)((ple, s) =>
      where(ple.playlistId === id and ple.songId === s.id)
      select(s)
      orderBy(ple.songNumber asc)
    )
}
]]></script>

  The select clause can return anything that is in the scope, for example it
  could return both joined objects with a Tuple2 : select((s, ple))


h2. The *join* keyword

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

    val ratingsForAllSongs =
      join(songs, ratings.leftOuter)((s,r) =>
          select(s, r)
          on(s.id === r.map(_.songId))
      )

    for(sr <- ratingsForAllSongs)
      println(sr._1.title + " rating is " + 
	  sr._2.map(r => r.appreciationScore.toString).getOrElse("not rated"))
	  
]]></script>

produces :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: sql"><![CDATA[
Select
  Song1.id as Song1_id,
  Rating2.songId as Rating2_songId,
  Rating2.songId as Rating2_songId,
  Rating2.appreciationScore as Rating2_appreciationScore,
  Rating2.userId as Rating2_userId,
  Song1.year as Song1_year,
  Song1.title as Song1_title,
  Song1.filePath as Song1_filePath,
  Song1.artistId as Song1_artistId,
  Song1.id as Song1_id
From
  Song Song1
  left outer join Rating as Rating2 on (Song1.id = Rating2.songId)
]]></script>


A join can also be an agreate query, for example :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[
    val q =
      join(artists,songs.leftOuter)((a,s)=>
        groupBy(a.id, a.firstName)
        compute(countDistinct(s.map(_.id)))
        on(a.id === s.map(_.authorId))
      )

]]></script>

The type of this query is *Query[GroupWithMeasures[(Long,String),Long]*, it produces the following SQL :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: sql"><![CDATA[
Select
  Person1.id as g0,
  Person1.firstName as g1,
  count(distinct Song2.id) as c0
From
Person Person1
left outer join Song as Song2 on (Person1.id = Song2.authorId)
Group By
  Person1.id,
  Person1.firstName
]]></script>
  
Of course, like in SQL, a *join* can have a where clause :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[
    val q =
      join(artists,songs.leftOuter)((a,s)=>
        where(a.id in myListOfArtistId)
        groupBy(a.id, a.firstName)
        compute(countDistinct(s.map(_.id)))
        on(a.id === s.map(_.authorId))
      )
]]></script>
  
  
  
If a join has N arguments, the 'on' function must take N-1 arguments,
the i'th 'on' condition corresponds to the i'th table expression :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

join(T, A1, A2,... AN)((a1,a2,...,aN) =>
  ...
  on(...condition for a1...,...condition for a2...,......condition for aN..., )
)
]]></script>
  
h2. Outer Joins _(deprecated syntax)_ 
  
A Left Outer Join is done by calling leftOuterJoin within the select clause,
where the fist parameter is the row object variable, and the second a boolean clause.

This query returns the joined objects in a tuple, leftOuterJoin causes the second tuple 
member to be an Option[Rating]

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

    val ratingsForAllSongs =
      from(songs, ratings)((s,r) =>
          select((s, leftOuterJoin(r, s.id === r.songId)))
      )

    for(sr <- ratingsForAllSongs)
      println(sr._1.title + " rating is " + 
	  sr._2.map(r => r.appreciationScore.toString).getOrElse("not rated"))
	  
]]></script>

The signatures of (left, right and full) outer joins ensure that the null part of the 
outer join returns an Option[] 

leftOuterJoin[A](a: A, b: =>LogicalBoolean): Option[A]

rightOuterJoin[A,B](a: A, b: B, c: =>LogicalBoolean): (Option[A], B)

fullOuterJoin[A,B](a: A, b:B, c: =>LogicalBoolean): (Option[A], Option[B])

The SQL of the previous query is : 

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: sql"><![CDATA[
Select
  Song1.id as Song1_id,
  Rating2.songId as Rating2_songId,
  Rating2.songId as Rating2_songId,
  Rating2.appreciationScore as Rating2_appreciationScore,
  Rating2.userId as Rating2_userId,
  Song1.year as Song1_year,
  Song1.title as Song1_title,
  Song1.filePath as Song1_filePath,
  Song1.artistId as Song1_artistId,
  Song1.id as Song1_id
From
  Song Song1
  left outer join Rating as Rating2 on (Song1.id = Rating2.songId)
]]></script>
