h2. A query that returns a primitive type or a Tuple of primitive types (ex.: Query[Int], Query[Int,String]) *can not* be used as a subquery

Nesting of such queries will result in an exception being thrown at definition time with this error message : 

_Sub query returns a primitive type or a Tuple of primitive type, and therefore is not useable as a subquery in a from or join clause_

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

  class Person(val firstName: val age: Int)    
  
  ASchema extends Schema {
    val people = table[Person]
  }

]]></script>

The following queries cannot be used as subqueries, except in an *in* clause :

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

  val peopleQuery1 = 
   from(people)(p => select(p.age))
   
  val peopleQuery2 = 
   from(people)(p => select(p.age, p.name))

 // NOT OK in a from clause :
 from(peopleQuery1)(x => select(x))
 from(peopleQuery2)(x => select(x._1))

 // results in runtime error:
 // Sub query returns a primitive type or a Tuple of primitive type, and therefore 
 // is not useable as a subquery in a from or join clause
 

 // OK in an IN clause :
 from(aTable)(t => t.aField in (peopleQuery1))
   
]]></script>

h3. Solution : Return the row object (the instance of A in table[A])

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

  // this query is not nestable (in a from clause) :
  val nonNestablePeopleQuery1 = 
   from(people)(p => select(p.age))
   
  // this one is :   
  val nestablePeopleQuery1 = 
   from(people)(p => select(p))
 
 // therefore nesting in a 'from' is possible :
 from(nestablePeopleQuery1)(x => select(x.age))
 
 // unlike this one, which will fail at definition time :
 from(nonNestablePeopleQuery1)(x => select(x))   
 
 // this kind of nesting is possible (provided of course that the 
 // type of aField is compatible with p.age) : 
 from(t)(x => where(x.aField in (nonNestablePeopleQuery1)) select(x))   
 
]]></script>

h2.  +, -, * and / operators can cause an ambiguity in PrimitiveTypeMode

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

  // Not OK  :
  val q1 = people.where(p=> p.age + 1 > 40)
   
  // OK :
  val q2 = people.where(p=> p.age plus 1 gt 40)
    
]]></script>
