h2. Dynamic Queries

It is often necessary to create queries that varies depending on values known only at runtime.

h3. Dynamically excluding tables (or sub queries) from a Query

The method *inhibitWhen(b: Boolean)* available on *org.squeryl.Queryable[A]* 
is meant to be called in a from clause, it will turn a Table[A] or (sub) Query[A]
into a Queryable[Option[A]] and remove the queryable from the query
*and* all expression referencing this queryable.

Example :

{% highlight scala %}

    def searchForBooks(authorLastName: Option[String], bookTitle: String) =
      from(authors.inhibitWhen(authorName == None), books)((a,b)=>
        where(a.get.lastName like authorLastName.get and b.title like bookTitle and a.get.id === b.authorId)
        select((b,a))
      )

	val result1:List[(Book,Option(Author))] = searchForBooks(None, "Un Loup est un loup").toList
	
	val result2:List[(Book,Option(Author))] = searchForBooks("Tolstoi", "War and Peace").toList
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the Option[] in the result type of the query, and how the Author
table disappears from the generated SQL base on the input of *inhibitWhen* :

{% highlight sql %}

  -- first query : searchForBooks(None, "Un Loup est un loup").toList
  
    Select * 
	from 
	  Book b 
	where 
	  b.title like ? -- 'Un Loup est un loup'

  -- second query :	 searchForBooks("Tolstoi", "War and Peace").toList 
  
	Select * 
	from 
	  Author a,
	  Book b
	where 
	  a.lastName like ? and   -- "Tolstoi"
	  b.title like ? and      -- "War and Peace"
	  a.id = b.authorId
{% endhighlight %}
