When a Schema is created, Squeryl uses Java reflection to determine the type of each database column.
For certain parameterized types, like Option, the differences between Scala and Java at the type level can make this challenging. While Scala treats all types as Objects, Java does not and has special rules for
"primitive" values such as int, long and boolean.  Part of Java's special treatment of primitive's excludes them from
use as type parameters, therefore in Java this definition would not compile:
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: java"><![CDATA[
  scala.Option<int> anOptionalInt
]]></script>
While an analogous definition in Scala would compile:
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[
  val anOptionalInt:Option[Int]
]]></script>
For versions prior to 2.9.0, when the Scala compiler encountered a definition like the one above it would create 
java bytecode that references the primitive type.  Unfortunately, doing so resulted in technically invalid byte code and led to issues with standard Java tools.  To resolve that issue the Scala compiler from version 2.9.0 onward replaces the primitive type with a reference to java.lang.Object in the generated byte code, which solves the tooling issue, but makes it very difficult to determine what the primitive type parameter is.

The solution adopted by Squeryl and several other popular Scala libraries is to use the scalap tool that ships with 
Scala to disassemble the Scala class and parse the type parameter included in the generated text. For most users
this won't be a problem, but for some, especially those who are developing for resource constrainted devices the 800k+
dependency might be an issue.  To account for that, Squeryl will attempt to determine whether scalap is available
at runtime before attempting to use it.  If scalap doesn't exist within your classpath, there are two alternatives
methods for defining an Option type.

# Use a org.squeryl.annotations.OptionType annotation to explicitly specify your option type parameter.
# Define a zero-argument constructor that intializes each Option field to a default Some() value

None of these methods are ideal, but they are the best available at the moment. A full fledged Scala reflection API is slated for Scala 2.10 so hopefully a native Scala solution for deducing Option type parameters will become available soon!
