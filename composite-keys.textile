h3. Declaring composite keys for self documentation and fulfilling KeyedEntity's contract 

The most compelling reason to use composite key is to implement the KeyedEntity trait (and enable it's functionality). It also has the advantage of documenting the fact that fields/columns form a composite key. Another benefit is that equality expressions can be shortened.

Consider the following example where CourseAssignment is a KeyedEntity[CompositeKey2[Long,Long]]

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

  class CourseAssignment(val courseId: Long, val professorId: Long) extends KeyedEntity[CompositeKey2[Long,Long]] {
    
    def id = compositeKey(courseId, professorId)
  }
]]></script>

CourseAssignment.id is a unique identifier for a CourseAssignment. In this case *id* is what makes the class a KeyedEntity[CompositeKey2[Long,Long]]. A class can have any number of composite keys, a composite key is not necessarily a primary key.

* *Important*: Squeryl will create a uniqueness constraint on composite keys that form the *id* of a KeyedEntity[_]  

* *Important*: a compositeKey cannot be a *val* it must be a *def*


A composite key can be used in any equality expression (x === y), against a 
composite key or a tuple that is compatible, i.e. that has the same type parameters, ex.:    

* CompositeKey3[String,Long,float] is compatible with Tuple3(String,Long,Float)

* CompositeKey2[Long,Int] is *not* compatible with Tuple2(Long,Long)

*Note* CompositeKeys cannot be used as binding expressions in relations (see : "issue 25":http://www.assembla.com/spaces/squeryl/tickets/25)
