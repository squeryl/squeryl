h3. 0.9.4-RC7

* #8    columns get duplicated in the select clause on Posos that have reentrant property accessors

* #40   Nested JOINs aren't mapped correctly
* #10   avg() not supporting BigDecimal type on RC4
* #27   inhibitWhen cannot be used with isNotNull
* #46   def id' on non composite KeyedEntity backed by another field causes assertion failure
* #48   Constant nodes sould have a mapper, or select(&lower("aConstant")) should work
* #1    Convert all tests to ScalaTest

h3. 0.9.4-RC6

*    Tool for consolidating multiple stats DBs

*    Fixed having clause, it was simply not working ...
*    Fix for gitHub issue 101
*    Fix for github issue 99 (join on computed column of aggregate query throws ClassCastException)
*    Fix for (github) issue 100 (Cannot use aggregate query on right hand side of an IN clause)

*    Support for subqueries in set clause of partial update, fixes #6
*    Closes #93: Add secondary constructors in custom types
*    Aggregate (groupBy and compute) return Group[ProductX] instead of Group[TupleX],
*    Closes #43: Equality expression not reversible in OneToMany
*    fixes #2: Support query pagination in DerbyAdapter
*    implicit conversion from boolean to LogicalBoolean, to allow this kind of syntax sugar :
<pre>      
    students.where(s => s.isMultilingual)
  as opposed to :
    students.where(s=> s.isMultilingual===true)    
</pre>	
*    fixes #3 (assign method in relations broken when using CustomTypes)
*    added Derby support
*    Quote identifiers in emitted SQL
*    Fix for issue 89 : update(T)(t => where(t.id in (subselect)) set(...))" generates invalid SQL
*    Fix bug in Session.cleanupResources.

*  MSSQL support (*note* : query pagination, not yet working...)
*  Fix for issue 51 : update fails with KeyedEntities[CompositeKey[...]]
*  Fix for issue 52 : regex expression not passed as param to jdbc prepared statement.


h3. 0.9.4-RC2

*   Fix for issue 48 (Exception thrown in outer join with subquery member)
