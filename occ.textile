h2. The org.squeryl.Optimistic trait

Classes that extend the Optimistic trait will have an optimistic concurrency control policy enforced. 

The Optimistic trait has the Int field *occVersionNumber* that gets incremented on each update, when updating via table[T].update(t:T), a StaleUpdateException is thrown if the row has been updated since 't' was fetched (i.e. if the occVersionNumber does not match the value it was fetched with). 

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

  class Book(val id: Long, 
             var title: String,
			 var authorId: Long) extends KeyedEntity[Long] with Optimistic
  
]]></script>


As can be seen below the org.squeryl.Optimistic trait has a self type declaration of KeyedEntity[], which means that a class must extend KeyedEntity[] in order extend Optimistic.  

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[

trait Optimistic {
  self: KeyedEntity[_] =>

  protected val occVersionNumber = 0
}

]]></script>

h3. Forcing updates

The Table[A] class have the methods *forceUpdate(a:A)* and *forceUpdate(a: Iterable[A])* to bypass the OCC mechanism
