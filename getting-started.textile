h3. The recommended version is 0.9.5-6

Supported Scala versions are 2.10.0, 2.9.2, 2.9.1, 2.9.0, 2.8.1 and 2.8.0

h2. SBT

After having setup your project to use SBT (see "how to setup SBT":http://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki)
Declare the Squeryl dependency in the SBT project definiition

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: scala"><![CDATA[
  
  libraryDependencies  ++=  Seq(
    "org.squeryl" %% "squeryl" % "0.9.5-6",
    yourDatabaseDependency
  )
   
  //yourDatabaseDependency is one of the supported databases : 
  
  val h2 = "com.h2database" % "h2" % "1.2.127"
  val mysqlDriver = "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.10"
  val posgresDriver = "postgresql" % "postgresql" % "8.4-701.jdbc4"
  val msSqlDriver = "net.sourceforge.jtds" % "jtds" % "1.2.4"
  val derbyDriver = "org.apache.derby" % "derby" % "10.7.1.1"

]]></script>
   
_*Note*_ : _The Oracle driver is not available via SBT/Maven, you will have to downloaded manually._

The remaining steps are :

# "Bootstrap the session factory":http://squeryl.org/sessions-and-tx.html
# "Define, and initialise a schema":http://squeryl.org/schema-definition.html

You should now be ready to insert, update, delete data, and of course run queries.

h3. Manual dependency management

If you want to manage your dependencies without SBT or Maven, you will need the following jars :

* The Scala runtime jar, version 2.10.0, 2.9.2, 2.9.1 (or 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.8.0)
* The Squeryl jar found "here":http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl/downloads
* The CGLIB cglib-nodep-2.2.jar, found "here":http://sourceforge.net/projects/cglib/files/
* A JDBC driver for your database, see "supported databases":./supported-databases.html
