h2. Building from Sources

Info on building is found "here":http://github.com/max-l/Squeryl

h2. Running the test suite

Testing on H2 doesn't require you to setup a database, if you build with "SBT":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool you will have an "H2":http://www.h2database.com/ database ready to run the tests, and if the test succeds on H2, making it work on other DBs should be straight forward.
